## AccelerateAI

AccelerateAI is a GPU cluster hosted at Swansea University.
Comprising 6 x Atos BullSequana nodes,
each with 8 x NVIDIA A100 GPUs,
it serves the machine learning needs of Wales.
It forms part of the Supercomputing Wales infrastructure.

GPUs are linked by NVLink in pairs.
Using more than 2 GPUs in parallel requires data transfer over the system bus.

### Gaining access

Access is restricted to members of the Supercomputing Wales partner institutions
and their external collaborators.
Access is initially via a user account and project request
to the [MySCW Service][myscw],
where access to AccelerateAI should be mentioned explicitly.

### Restrictions

By default,
jobs may use up to 4 GPUs.
Runs with more than 4 GPUs may be enabled
when evidence of scalability of a project's work to 4 GPUs is demonstrated,
since the system is not designed for scalability to large GPU counts,
and many problems will not scale well.

Jobs may run for up to 48 hours.
