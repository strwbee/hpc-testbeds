## COSMA GH200

COSMA (The Compute Optimised System for Modelling and Analysis) is a High Performance Computing facility hosted at Durham University, operated by the Institute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of DiRAC.

The H100 NVL (Hopper) node is a GPU testbed within COSMA.

| Node | RAM | CPU | Access |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| gn004 | 510GB | 64 cores (Intel Xeon) | Direct SSH |

The H100 NVL is a high-memory variant of NVIDIA's H100. It is optimised for LLM Inference because of its high memory bandwidth, compute density, and energy efficiency.

### Gaining access

Access requires a COSMA account, obtained via the [DiRAC SAFE portal](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/dirac/).

1. Create a SAFE account with an institutional email.
2. Upload an SSH public key on SAFE. If you do not have one, generate with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`.
2. Request a login account. This requires selecting a project, either:
- Project `do016` for testbed access.
- A DiRAC project code for a given allocation (provided by a supervisor).
3. **Wait** for the account to be approved by the project manager. Keep an eye on your email!
4. Connect to COSMA via SSH: `ssh username@login8.cosma.dur.ac.uk` (Note: On first login you will be asked to change the password provided in your email)

Visit <https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/account.html> for more details.
Contact cosma-support@durham.ac.uk for any questions.

### Usage

Connect directly to gn004 via SSH from a login node:
```bash
ssh gn004
nvidia-smi
./gpu_program_to_run
```

### Restrictions

- Shared resource. Before running large jobs, check if others are using the nodes. Access is SSH only, so there is no SLURM queue
- CUDA is available via `module load nvhpc/25.11`
